         captions on Tumblr. These photos may be photoshopped to change the
         dog's face or captioned with interior monologues in Comic Sans font.
         The use of the misspelled word "doge" to refer to a dog dates back
         to June 24th, 2005, when it was mentioned in an episode of Homestar
         Runner's puppet show. In the episode titled "Biz Cas Fri 1",
         Homestar calls Strong Bad his "d-o-g-e" while trying to distract him
